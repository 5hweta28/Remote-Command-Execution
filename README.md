# Remote-Command-Execution
**Problem Description:**

Design a Python-based system for remote command execution using socket programming. The system should allow a client to connect to a server and execute shell commands on the server machine remotely. Implement the following functionalities:

**Requirements:**

1. Server Operations:

- The server should be able to handle multiple client connections simultaneously.
  
- Display a list of connected clients.

- Accept commands from connected clients for remote execution.
2. Client Operations:
 Clients should be able to connect to the server.
 Clients can send shell commands to the server for execution.
 Receive and display the output/results of the executed command.
3. Command Protocol:
 Define a simple protocol for sending and receiving commands. Include information
such as the command to execute, command parameters, and results.

4. User Interface:

 Implement a basic command-line or text-based user interface for clients to interact
with the server and execute commands.

5. Security Measures:
 Implement basic security measures to authenticate clients and ensure secure
communication.
 Ensure that clients can only execute predefined, safe commands on the server.
6. Error Handling:
 Implement error handling mechanisms to deal with scenarios like client
disconnections and invalid commands.

7. Optional Enhancements:
 Allow clients to upload/download files to/from the server.
